# Project: The "Zero-Copy" Multi-Protocol Proxy Suite

### Objective

Build an extreme-performance Rust proxy with zero-copy optimizations, deployed on automated Kubernetes infrastructure, featuring kernel-level and kernel-bypass techniques for maximum throughput.

### Core Components

*   **Multi-Protocol Proxy (Rust):** Single-port async proxy handling HTTP/HTTPS, SOCKS4/5, and QUIC with zero-copy optimizations
*   **State Management Service (Rust):** API-key protected service for user credentials and ACLs in PostgreSQL
*   **Message Broker:** Real-time configuration updates (RabbitMQ/NATS) without proxy restarts

### Supported Protocols & Optimizations

*   **Protocols:** HTTP/HTTPS, SOCKS4/5 (with authentication), QUIC (UDP-based)
*   **Zero-Copy Techniques:**
    *   **`splice()` System Call:** Kernel-level zero-copy for TCP streams, eliminating userspace data copying
    *   **PF_RING ZC:** Kernel-bypass for ultra-low latency, direct NIC memory access for line-rate packet processing

### Professional Performance Benchmarking & Validation

The project must include a comprehensive benchmarking suite to validate and demonstrate the extreme performance claims. This benchmarking infrastructure is essential for proving the effectiveness of the zero-copy optimizations.

**Core Performance Validation Requirements:**

*   **Zero-Copy Validation:** Gbps throughput measurement, CPU utilization analysis, memory bandwidth impact, and latency distribution (P50-P99.9) comparing `splice()` vs. standard proxying
*   **PF_RING ZC Performance:** Line-rate packet processing (PPS), nanosecond-level latency validation, CPU core affinity optimization, and DPDK-style memory pool efficiency
*   **Multi-Protocol Benchmarks:** HTTP/HTTPS, SOCKS4/5, and QUIC performance measurement with mixed protocol load testing
*   **Infrastructure Validation:** Kubernetes CNI overhead, multi-homed pod efficiency, service mesh impact, and auto-scaling performance
*   **Squid Proxy Comparison:** Head-to-head throughput, concurrent connection limits, memory footprint analysis, CPU utilization comparison, and enterprise load simulation
*   **Continuous Monitoring:** Real-time dashboards, regression detection, historical analysis, and comparative tools integrated with Prometheus/Grafana

### Kubernetes Infrastructure

*   **Automated Deployment:** Script-based HA cluster provisioning with `kubeadm`, Calico CNI, and Multus for multi-homed pods
*   **Security & Monitoring:** Zero-trust NetworkPolicy, Prometheus/Grafana observability stack
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** Umbrella Helm chart with multi-stage Dockerfiles
*   **Performance Validation:** Comprehensive benchmarking infrastructure with statistical analysis
