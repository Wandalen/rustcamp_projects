# Project: The "Zero-Copy" Multi-Protocol Proxy Suite

### High-Level Objective

Develop and deploy a secure, multi-protocol proxy application onto a fully automated, high-availability Kubernetes cluster. The central challenge is to engineer a Rust-based proxy capable of extreme throughput by implementing both kernel-level and kernel-bypass zero-copy optimizations, supported by a robust, production-grade infrastructure.

### The Application Suite: Core Components

The project consists of three main software components designed to work in concert:

*   **An Ultra-Performance, Multi-Protocol Proxy (Rust):** The core of the project. This is a single, asynchronous Rust application that functions as a highly versatile and performant network proxy. It will listen on a single port and dynamically handle a wide array of protocols.
*   **A Persistent State Management Service (Rust):** A secure web service, protected by an API key, for managing user credentials and Access Control Lists (ACLs) in a PostgreSQL database.
*   **A Message Broker (e.g., RabbitMQ, NATS):** A messaging system that allows the State Management Service to publish real-time updates to the proxy, which will update its in-memory user/ACL configuration without requiring a restart.

### Proxy: Supported Protocols

The proxy must be engineered to parse, manage, and forward connections for the following protocols:

*   **HTTP & HTTPS:** Standard web traffic proxying.
*   **SOCKS5:** The modern standard for circuit-level proxies, including full support for username/password authentication.
*   **SOCKS4:** Support for the legacy SOCKS protocol for backward compatibility.
*   **QUIC:** Handling the modern, UDP-based transport protocol to proxy next-generation web traffic.

### Proxy: Core Performance Optimizations

To achieve the goal of "extreme throughput," the proxy's design will implement two powerful zero-copy techniques, chosen based on the traffic type:

*   **Kernel-Level Zero-Copy (`splice`):** For TCP-based streams (HTTP, HTTPS, SOCKS4/5), the proxy will leverage the `splice(2)` system call. This powerful Linux feature moves data directly between the input and output socket buffers entirely within the kernel, avoiding the performance penalty of copying data into userspace. This dramatically reduces CPU load and increases throughput for TCP forwarding.
*   **Kernel-Bypass (`PF_RING ZC`):** For scenarios demanding the absolute lowest latency and highest packet processing rates, the proxy will integrate with `PF_RING ZC (Zero Copy)`. This advanced technique allows the application to bypass the kernel's network stack entirely, reading packets directly from the NIC's memory into userspace. This enables true zero-copy packet processing at line-rate speeds, making it ideal for handling high-volume UDP-based traffic like QUIC or other specialized, latency-sensitive workloads.

### Kubernetes Infrastructure and Automation

The application suite will be deployed on a platform with the following characteristics:

*   **Automated Cluster Provisioning:** A single script (`Makefile` or `bash`) will automate the creation of a high-availability Kubernetes cluster using `kubeadm` over SSH.
*   **Advanced Networking:** The cluster will be configured with **Calico** as the primary CNI and **Multus** as a meta-CNI to allow for multi-homed pods, which is essential for dedicating specific network interfaces to the `PF_RING`-accelerated proxy.
*   **Security & Observability:** A zero-trust network model will be enforced using Kubernetes `NetworkPolicy`. A full observability stack using **Prometheus** and **Grafana** will be deployed to monitor custom application metrics from the proxy and state service.
*   **Infrastructure as Code:** The entire application suite will be packaged as a single, configurable "umbrella" **Helm chart** for repeatable, automated deployments.
*   **Containerization:** Efficient, multi-stage `Dockerfiles` will be provided for both Rust applications.

### Short Learning Roadmap

This roadmap is structured in phases, building foundational knowledge before tackling the project's most complex challenges.

#### Phase 1: Foundations in Rust and Networking

*   **Goal:** Master the core tools and concepts.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Learn Rust:** Go beyond the basics. Focus on ownership, lifetimes, traits, and error handling.
    2.  **Master Asynchronous Rust:** Complete a deep dive into `tokio`. Build a simple TCP echo server and a multi-client chat application to understand async tasks and channels.
    3.  **Build a Simple Proxy:** Create a basic, single-threaded TCP stream-forwarding proxy in Rust that copies data from an input socket to an output socket through a userspace buffer.
    4.  **Containerize It:** Write a multi-stage `Dockerfile` for the simple proxy and learn to build and run it.

#### Phase 2: Building the Application Suite (Standard Implementation)

*   **Goal:** Develop the full application suite without the advanced zero-copy optimizations.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Implement Protocols:** Extend your proxy to parse and handle SOCKS4, SOCKS5 (with auth), and HTTP. Focus on robust protocol parsing.
    2.  **Build the State Service:** Create the Rust web service using `Axum`. Connect it to PostgreSQL with `sqlx` to manage users/ACLs. Secure the API endpoint with an API key.
    3.  **Integrate Messaging:** Deploy RabbitMQ or NATS. Have the state service publish messages on changes. The proxy will subscribe to these messages and update its in-memory configuration.
    4.  **Learn Kubernetes Basics:** Deploy your application suite to a simple Kubernetes cluster (like `minikube` or `k3s`). Learn to write Deployments, Services, and ConfigMaps.

#### Phase 3: Infrastructure Automation & Observability

*   **Goal:** Build a production-grade, automated deployment platform.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Master `kubeadm`:** Practice setting up a multi-node Kubernetes cluster on VMs using `kubeadm` and `bash` scripts.
    2.  **Package with Helm:** Learn Helm and convert your Kubernetes YAML files into a single, configurable umbrella chart.
    3.  **Advanced Networking:** Install Calico and Multus on your `kubeadm` cluster. Practice creating a pod with two network interfaces.
    4.  **Implement Observability:** Deploy the Prometheus/Grafana stack. Instrument your Rust applications to expose custom metrics (e.g., active connections, data transferred per protocol) and build a Grafana dashboard.

#### Phase 4: Extreme Performance & Zero-Copy Integration

*   **Goal:** Implement the core performance challenge of the project.
*   **Steps:**
    1.  **Kernel-Level Zero-Copy (`splice`):** Study the `splice(2)` man pages. Use the `nix` crate in Rust to make the system call. Modify your TCP proxy logic to use `splice` for forwarding data between sockets instead of a userspace buffer. Benchmark the performance difference.
    2.  **Implement QUIC:** Integrate a QUIC library like `quinn` to add UDP-based proxying capabilities.
    3.  **Kernel-Bypass (`PF_RING ZC`):** This is the most advanced step.
        *   Study the `PF_RING` documentation thoroughly.
        *   Set up a dedicated network interface on a test machine for `PF_RING`.

        *   Use Rust's FFI to call into the `libpfring` C library.
        *   Write a simple proof-of-concept in Rust that can read packets directly from the NIC using `PF_RING ZC`.
        *   Integrate this logic into your proxy as the data path for QUIC/UDP traffic, bypassing the kernel entirely for that interface. This will require running the proxy pod with high privileges and mounting the specific device.
